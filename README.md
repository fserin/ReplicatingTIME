# ReplicatingTIME
This repository includes the R scripts for the data analysis of the experiments that attempts to replicate theta-induced memory effect (Clouter et al., 2018).

The folder Experiment_1_2_3 includes the behavioural analysis of all these experiments as well as the mini meta-analysis for the effect.

The folder Serin et al. includes the specific version of Experiment 2 behavioural analysis that was published as Serin et al. ([2024](https://doi.org/10.1177/23982128241255798))

The last one, MEG Analysis/PhaseLag Analysis, includes the analysis of the MEG data that was acquired with Experiment 2.

R scripts are written in R markdown and outputs a .pdf and the main figures when run.
