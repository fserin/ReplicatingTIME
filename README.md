# ReplicatingTIME
This repository includes the R scripts for the data analysis of Serin et al. ([2024](https://doi.org/10.1177/23982128241255798)) that attempts to replicate theta-induced memory effect (Clouter et al., 2018).

There are two parts: One folder for the Serin et al. paper and one folder for the thesis that includes analyses beyond the paper.

R scripts are written in R markdown and outputs a .pdf and the main figures when run.
